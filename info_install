Pre-requisites

You should be an existing Vim user or keen to learn Neovim and NvChad (through these docs).
Neovim 0.8.0, if your distro/OS doesn't have it then try neovim version manager.
Use a Nerd Font in your terminal emulator.
Make sure to delete this folder ~/.local/share/nvim on Linux/macOS or ~\AppData\Local\nvim and ~\AppData\Local\nvim-data on Windows.
Semi-optional
ripgrep is required for grep searching with Telescope.


Install

Linux / macOS (UNIX)
git clone https://github.com/norta92/NvChad ~/.config/nvim --depth 1 && nvim


Update

NvChad has an update mechanism built-in, which will pull any new updates from the git repository.

Update NvChad by pressing <leader> + uu

Note: by NvChad default, <leader> is the <space> key.

This will open a prompt in Neovim warning you that it is about to do a git reset --hard 
and you will lose any customisations you've made to NvChad outside the custom folder.


Uninstall

# linux/macos (unix)
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim
rm -rf ~/.cache/nvim
